# ReadMeWithNode

## Description of the Project

Given that creating a README file can be time consuming, having an application that creates quickly the framework of a README file allow progammers to allocates more time into their coding projects. Afterall, all README.md has the same structure but contains different content. Upon bulding this application, I learned how to build a README.md dynamically with Node.js and Inquirer (verison 8.2.4). This application requires you to understand package.json and its node_modules. In additon to that, gitignore file is important to use so certain folders and files are not upload to GitHub. For example, node_modules should not be uploaded to GitHub since this folder gets created during the installition process. Lastly, this project stands out since this application builds a README.md file dynamically.
