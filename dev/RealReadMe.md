## Description of the Project

Given that creating a README file can be time consuming, having an application that creates quickly the framework of a README file allow progammers to allocates more time into their coding projects. Afterall, all README.md has the same structure but contains different content. Upon bulding this application, I learned how to build a README.md dynamically with Node.js and Inquirer (verison 8.2.4). This application requires you to understand package.json and its node_modules. In additon to that, gitignore file is important to use so certain folders and files are not upload to GitHub. For example, node_modules should not be uploaded to GitHub since this folder gets created during the installition process. Lastly, this project stands out since this application builds a README.md file dynamically.



## Installation
To create this project, follow these several steps. This application uses Node.js and Inquirer (verison 8.2.4). Step one, download Node.js. Next go to the terminal of the index.js and type this command ```npm install```. This creates package.json file and inquirer@8.2.4. 


## Usage

To use this application, open the terminal, respective to the file. Run the ```node index.js``` in the terminal. Then, answer the following questions. Finally, the README.md will be created. 

This is what the README.md will look like when deployed.
